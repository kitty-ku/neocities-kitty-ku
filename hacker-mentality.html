			<h1>Anyone can hack</h1>
			<div style="opacity: 40%;">Any similarity to Ratatouille characters, living by movie magic or dead from
				getting criticized once might seem purely coincidental but is totally intended. Ha.
			</div>
			<h3>But I don't even know what cache invalidation is</h3>
			<p>
				Get this straight, it doesn't take a hacker to know this.
				Some might hint at you some nebulous "cache coherence" or "race condition" or "naming things" shmuck,
				but actually <i>knowing</i> about any of this
				<strong>does not make a hacker</strong>.
				Neither does one become a hacker by breaking into the mainframe to ransom for enterprise databases nor
				by bootstrapping a startup on industrial-grade coffee and leftover mediterranean cuisine.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you know what those words mean, you're a professional. Hats off to you. This document is not about
				you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hackers might <i>do</i> those, and it takes a hacker to do it well,
				but proper <strong class="hacker-mentality">hacker mentality</strong>
				can be found anywhere. So, who is this piece about?
			</p>
			<h3>Story time</h3>
			<p>
				In the summer of 2025 I have first visited <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>.
				I had heard this is the place
				where cool stuff gets springboarded to public (computer nerd public) awareness
				and where shady folks spread news of exploitable computer bugs
				and I had deluded myself into having time to spare.
			</p>
			<div style="opacity: 50%; text-align: center; margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em;">
				Before further reading I suggest you go there yourself, take in the experience. <br>
				It's nothing like I described above. <br>
				There will be no photos in further reading, so better go get the picture.
			</div>
			<div style="margin-top: 7em;"></div>
			<div style="opacity: 50%; text-align: center; margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em;">
				No photos!
			</div>
			<p>
				I (we?) dipped my (our?) paws (whatever you normies have) in and,
				as should have been expected,
				people are generally chill.
				What one probably notices at first is that most of the things on the main page
				are not interesting. <br>
				Neither is the layout.
			</p>
			<p>
				You could read the first clue that hackers are uninteresting, but we're talking
				<strong>computer professionals</strong> being uninteresting. Again, hackering is something else.
				Let me guide your attention to the page layout instead.
				It's... bare. When you click a "post", you leave the uninteresting Hacker News.
				The comments have no likes. Users have no profile pictures. The only piece of color is the website
				header.
				(They're ripping <a href="kitty-ku.neocities.org">kitty-ku.neocities.org</a>)
			</p>
			<p>
				Most importantly, the comment <i>contents</i> are also boring, but in a different way.
				Again, look beyond computer nerd word salad, and focus on the language.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dry. Sharp. Precise. <i>Professional</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's as if hackers over at Hacker News share their news in an orderly, uninteresting way.
				<strong>That</strong> is what makes a hacker. And it's very interesting.
			</p>

			<h3>Thesis</h3>
			<div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em;">
				The hacker mentality is to seek
				separation of <br> functionality from form and <br>
				utilize technology directly.
			</div>

			<p>
				In perspective: computer hackers fit the thesis. They like to scrape down the available
				tech to their bare essentials and expose its true potential.
			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>They find bugs in programs with millions of deployments without regard for their market
					position</li>
				<li>They use a cuckoo clock to push the restart button on their self-hosting laptop every 12 hours</li>
				<li>They run DOOM on stolen car keys because DOOM can run on stolen car keys</li>
			</ul>
			Their news has no headlines. Their comments have no following, elicit no reactions. Only further comments.
			Everything else is useless. I can guarantee, a lot of readers on HN probably don't even read their news on a
			typical web browser, just read the text on the website plain in their fancy Matrix screens.
			For a Hacker, <i>form</i> doesn't <i>follow</i> function. There is no form.
			</p>

			<h3>Ok, computer?</h3>
			<p>
				You can separate form from everything, not just online news &mdash; and maybe you should.
				We live in times of heavy marketing, social media distorts every social aspect of our lives at
				the altars of investor interests, and technology giants do everything in their power to stop you
				from asking uncomfortable questions about what <i>exactly</i> their products do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Think every household's instant village idiot, the untrusty LLM. The <i>form</i> it's packaged with
				<i>suggests</i> its language proficiency translates into brilliance. But we dismiss the form, and its
				function is what it does. News flash - it's autocorrect. It is the Don Quixote of tools,
				it read a billion books word for word, but barely sentence for sentence. It mimics the average Joe, and
				as such is mediocre by design.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can separate form from <i>everything</i>, Not just computer stuff. A board game is only as good as
				its rules, the artwork is extra. Your food is nutrition, flavor, and smell. The function of cooking is
				to eat and enjoy the process. The process itself does not matter beyond its bare utility - and enjoyment
				is a great use.
			</p>

			<h3>To hack, or not to hack?</h3>
			<p>
				It's up to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				I recommend the formless hacker lifestyle, for one because it's a one that manipulative marketing
				ghouls have a hard time infiltrating, but more importantly - it gets you thinking about what things
				around you and your behaviours mean to you.
