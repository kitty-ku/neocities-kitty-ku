      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>me name be kit and me an interweb kitty, yarr.</p>
      <p>Oh, you mean <i>me</i>? I'm a Computer Science student at the <a href="https://pg.edu.pl/">Fucking Shit
          Technical University</a> and I <strong>do not want to</strong> talk
        about it. I do like the Computer Science part though. <br />
        One could probably infer that from a CS student I would aspire to become a CS practicioner and, sure, why not.
        <br />
        I also have <i>strong</i> beliefs about the current state of Technology, which is something all personal website
        owners nowadays have in common.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allegedly I also have some artistic tendencies, big surprise for the reader. Somewhere beneath the immature
        cynicism and ironic self-deprecation there seemingly lies a kind, delicate, artsy soul.

      </ul>
      I also use the abhorrence that is Facebook Messenger but I hate it so much using it to meet new people would make me hate it more for ruining the experience.
      I am not and will not be on social media for the forseeable future. Sorry not sorry, doctor's orders (not really (but if I had the guts to see a doctor they would probably agree))
